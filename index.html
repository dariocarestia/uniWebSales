        <div class="faq">
            <h3>How is this possible?</h3>
            <p>Meet the Project Creator:</p>
            <p>Hello! My name is Dario Carestia, an Electronics Engineer, University Professor, and Specialist in Application Software Development in the field of Engineering. I am also one of the owners of Mundo Leds (www.mundoleds.com.ar), a small lighting store located in San Juan, Argentina, dedicated to selling a wide range of LED technology products.</p>
            <p>As a business owner of Mundo Leds and a user of uniCenta oPOS, I understand the importance of having an online presence to reach more customers. Aware of the challenges faced by small retail stores in having dedicated personnel for web content management, I developed a unique solution that seamlessly integrates with the uniCenta oPOS database.</p>
            <p>My goal is to provide other stores using uniCenta oPOS with the opportunity to have their own user-friendly and automated web e-commerce platform. By connecting directly to their database, the platform automatically adapts to their inventories, prices, and product descriptions.</p>
            <p>I am thrilled to offer this solution to other stores, empowering them to harness the full potential of e-commerce without any additional complexities.</p>
        
            <h3>How to integrate with uniCenta oPOS?</h3>
            <p>Select a web host, upload provided files, and configure using the guide. Receive a package with files and installation instructions for a smooth setup.</p>
        
            <h3>Can I obtain the source code as a distributor of uniCenta-based solutions?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely! The package includes Angular + Bootstrap (frontend) and PHP + MySQL (backend) source code, allowing for customization and deployment across your client base.</p>
        
            <h3>Compatibility with my uniCenta version?</h3>
            <p>uniWebSales requires only two POS program tables. The provided synchronization tool easily adapts to any forked version of uniCenta, ensuring a straightforward process.</p>
        
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>You can see how it works in the following YouTube video: <a href="https://youtu.be/x7AlBi5vyFc" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/x7AlBi5vyFc</a></p>
        
            <h3>Can I rename the website?</h3>
            <p>Certainly! You can customize all the data for your store, including the store name, logo, phone number, etc., as well as the metadata for SEO purposes. Additionally, you can modify the styles via CSS files. Within the distribution package, you'll find instructions for the entire configuration process. Simply edit the necessary files using a text editor.</p>
